A Haskell library for writing FastCGI programs
=========

This library lets you write FastCGI programs. This package reuses the
cgi package API, making it very easy to port CGI programs to FastCGI.
The FastCGI C development kit is required to build this library.

Build:

    $ git clone git://github.com/chrisdone/haskell-json.git
    $ cd haskell-json
    $ cabal install
